The Law of Criticality - Challenge to Falsify

The Universal Law of Criticality: I propose the Emergence Field Equation (EΣ4) 

 which posits that structural phase transitions across all complex systems are universally preceded by a critical spike in the fourth-order curvature of structural contradiction (∇^4)

 C(x)). This is the mathematical signature of inevitable systemic reorganization.

I invite the global scientific community to attempt to falsify this law.

The Empirical Evidence (The Three Tests):

Prediction of Cognition: The ∇4

  signal precedes the exact moment of emergence (Grokking) in a deep neural network.

Null Hypothesis: The signal fails to fire when the emergence event is blocked.

Universality: The signal correlates with maximal systemic tension during global financial crises (2000-2023).

The evidence suggests the collapse of complexity is not chaotic but mathematically necessary
